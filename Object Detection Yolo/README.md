## **Features**

* Detect multiple objects in images and videos.
* Easy-to-run Python scripts for testing on custom images/videos.
* Visualizes bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores.

## **Requirements**

* Python
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on YOLO version used)
